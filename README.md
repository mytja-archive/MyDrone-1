Code for smart BLDC drones. Written in Arduino C with :heart:

# About

This is a simple code written in Arduino C, that controlls BLDC motors as drones.

# Currently supports
Gyroscope: MPU9250  In work!!!

NRF24L01 - RF modules

Simple movements - forward, backward... (not yet up-right...)

# You can see code in 2 branches
Transmitter code is here: https://github.com/mytja/MyDrone-1/tree/transmitter

Here is drone code: https://github.com/mytja/MyDrone-1/tree/drone

(upper branches won't be supported after a short amount of while...)

They all join together in:
- Guinea pig (Very early release) - (https://github.com/mytja/MyDrone-1/tree/guinea)
- Beta - (https://github.com/mytja/MyDrone-1/tree/beta) and 
- master (Stable) - (https://github.com/mytja/MyDrone-1/tree/master)
